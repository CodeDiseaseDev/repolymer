# Polymer
In-development Minecraft client using C++ and Vulkan.

It can only connect to offline Java servers at the moment, but online mode is planned. There's currently no physics, but there's a spectator-like camera for looking around.  

It uses the original assets from a user-provided Minecraft jar. Only basic blocks can be rendered at the moment.
